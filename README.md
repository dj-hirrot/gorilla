## About

Gorilla template is a project that introduces "CleanArchitecture" and project structure approaches to developing Go REST API server.

## Features
- It's **implemented with the CleanArchitecture design philosophy**.
- By annotating the functions, **Swagger documentation can be generated automatically**.
- **Mocks can be generated automatically** based on the abstracted class.
- It runs on a Docker container, and **hot reloading by "fresh"** is applied.
- (CI has been introduced in GitHub Workflow).

| Layer | Description |
| --- | ------- |
| `./docker/api/*` | API Container |
| `./docker/db/*` | DB Container. In this project, MySQL is used, but the hierarchy is divided so that other databases can be supported. |
| `./docker/db/init.sql` | It will be placed and executed `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` when the container is started. |
| `./docs/*` | Swagger Docs will be generated here. You can view it by accessing `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` with your browser. |
| `./mocks/*` | The file generated by mockgen will be placed here. You can run tests on abstract classes. |
| `./src/*` | The application |
| `./src/domain/*` | Enterprise Business Rules |
| `./src/usecase/*` | Application Business Rules |
| `./src/interface/*` | Interface Adapters |
| `./src/infrastructure/*` | Frameworks & Drivers |
